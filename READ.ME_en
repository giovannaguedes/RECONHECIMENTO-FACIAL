FACIAL-RECOGNITION

‚óΩÔ∏è Guide: Facial Recognition with Flask + face_recognition

This software combines Flask (web backend), OpenCV, and the face_recognition library to build a login/identification app based on photos stored in a dataset.

1. Frontend (index.html)

A Tailwind CSS responsive page. It contains:

Webcam API to capture the face.

Canvas overlay to mark the capture area.

"Start Recognition" button that sends the image to the server.

Digital badge displaying:

User photo (from dataset)

Recognized name

Login date and time

Word of the day

2. Backend (app.py)
Loading the Dataset

Reads each file in the dataset/ folder.

Extracts the facial embedding with face_recognition.

Stores the filename as the user‚Äôs name and the facial vector (encoding).

3. Facial Recognition (route /start_recognition)

Receives a photo from the user (request.files['image']).

Converts it into a NumPy array (cv2.imdecode).

Extracts face_encodings from the uploaded image.

Compares against the dataset using:

compare_faces ‚Üí Boolean (match or not).

face_distance ‚Üí Distance (smaller = more similar).

If distance < 0.6, the user is recognized.

Returns JSON to the frontend with:

Name

Date

Time

Original dataset photo

4. Attendance Logging
if not any(record['Name'] == name for record in attendance):
    attendance.append({'Name': name, 'Time': time_now})
    pd.DataFrame(attendance).to_excel('attendance.xlsx', index=False)


Prevents duplicate entries for the same user.

Saves logs to an Excel file (attendance.xlsx).

5. Full Workflow

User opens http://localhost:5000/
.

The system requests webcam access.

A photo is captured and sent via POST ‚Üí /start_recognition.

Flask processes it and compares against the dataset.

If recognized:

Displays name, photo, and digital badge.

Saves attendance log to Excel.
